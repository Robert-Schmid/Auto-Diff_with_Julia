# Auto-Diff with Julia

:warning:__Caution:__ This is very much work in progress.

I'm currently doing this for a course at Uni, but since I found that there is a lack of tutorials, and the once I found are all over the place, I thought I would gather them here.
My goal is to turn this into a cohesive introduction with hands-on tutorials, but for now it's just a conglomeration of things I found elsewhere.


## Basics of Automatic Differentiation
Based on Mike Innes [diff-zoo](https://github.com/MikeInnes/diff-zoo).
You can find some Jupyther notebooks over there.

Here I try to give an overview of the basics.


## Auto-Diff with Zygote
Based on the talk by Viral Shah and Elliot Saba, [Models as Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv3d0k7wWHk).

This is ment to give some concrete examples of applications to play around with.
